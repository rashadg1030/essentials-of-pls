Exercise 1.1 [*] Write inductive definitions of the following sets.  
Write each definition in all three styles (top-down, bottom-up, and rules of inference).  
Using your rules, show the derivation of some sample elements of each set.

ex. {n * 2 | n ∈ N}
    Let G = {n * 2 | n ∈ N}
    Top-down:
    A natural number n is in G if and only if
    1. n = 0
    or 
    2. n - 2 ∈ G

1. { 3n + 2 | n ∈ N }

   Let P = { 3n + 2 | n ∈ N }

   Top-down:
   A natural number n is in P if and only if
   1. n = 2
   or
   2. n - 3 ∈ P

   Bottom-up:
   Let P be the smallest set contained in N and satisfying the
   following two properties
   1. 2 ∈ P 
   and
   2. If n ∈ P, then ( n + 3 ) ∈ P  ( n ∈ P -> ( n + 3 ) ∈ P ) 

   Rules-of-inference:
   /2 ∈ P 

   n ∈ P/( n + 3 ) ∈ P 

2. { 2n + 3m + 1 | n, m ∈ N }
    
   Let T = { 2n + 3m + 1 | n, m ∈ N }

   Top-down:
   A natural number n is in T if and only if
   1. n = 1
   or
   2. ( n - 2 ) ∈ T
   or 
   3. ( n - 3 ) ∈ T
   
   Bottom-up:
   Let T be the smallest subset contained in N and satisfying the 
   following two properties
   1. 1 ∈ T
   and
   2. If n ∈ T, then ( n + 2 ) ∈ T or ( n + 3 ) ∈ T

   Rules-of-inference:
   /1 ∈ T

   n ∈ T/( n + 2 ) ∈ T or ( n + 3 ) ∈ T

3. { ( n, 2n + 1 ) | n ∈ N }
   
   Let Y = { ( n, 2n + 1 ) | n ∈ N }

   Top-down: 
   A pair of natural numbers (p, q) is in Y if and only if
   1. p = 0 and q = 1
   or
   2. ( ( p - 1 ), ( q - 2 ) ) ∈ Y  

   Let P = { (m, n) | m, n ∈ N }
   Bottom-up:
   Let Y be the smallest subset contained in P and satisfying the
   following two properties
   1. ( 0, 1 ) ∈ Y
   and
   2. If ( p, q ) ∈ Y, then ( p + 1, q + 2 ) ∈ Y   

   Rules-of-inference
   /( 0, 1 ) ∈ Y

   ( p, q ) ∈ Y/( p + 1, q + 2 ) ∈ Y 

4. { ( n, n^2 ) | n ∈ N } 

   Let V = { ( n, n^2 ) | n ∈ N }

   Do not mention squaring in your rules. 
   As a hint, remember the equation ( n + 1 )^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1 = n( n + 2 ) + 1   

   Top-down:
   A pair of natural numbers ( a, b ) is in V if and only if
   1. a = 0 and b = 0
   or 
   2. ( ( a - 1 ), (  ) )

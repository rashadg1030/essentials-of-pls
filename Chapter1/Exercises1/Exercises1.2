Exercise 1.2 [**] What sets are defined by the following pairs of rules? Explain why.

1. ( 0, 1 ) ∈ S  
   ( n, k ) ∈ S / ( n + 1, k + 7 ) ∈ S

   Using rules-of-induction:
   ( 0, 1 ) ∈ S
   -> ( 1, 8 ) ∈ S
   -> ( 2, 15 ) ∈ S
   -> ( 3, 22 ) ∈ S
   -> ( 4, 29 ) ∈ S
   -> ...
    
   This set can be defined as { ( n, 7n + 1 ) | n ∈ N }

2. (0, 1) ∈ S
   ( n, k ) ∈ S / ( n + 1, 2k ) ∈ S

   Using rules-of-induction:
   (0, 1) ∈ S
   -> ( 1, 2 ) ∈ S 
   -> ( 2, 4 ) ∈ S
   -> ( 3, 8 ) ∈ S
   -> ( 4, 16 ) ∈ S
   -> ...

   This set can be defined as { ( n, k ) | n, k ∈ N }
